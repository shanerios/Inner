  'new': 'Within the dark womb of the void, the moon hides her light to dream creation into being. Those who listen here may hear the original pulse of Source—the spark before form.',
  'waxing-crescent': 'A sliver of light pierces the veil, signaling birth through intention. In hidden orders, this is the phase of invocation—where thought meets breath and begins to weave the unseen.',
  'first-quarter': 'The moon divides shadow and light, testing the integrity of all beginnings. Esoteric adepts say it is the alchemical friction that tempers will into wisdom.',
  'waxing-gibbous': 'The lunar vessel swells with gathering power. Ancient mystics observed this time as the shaping of reality—when consciousness molds light toward manifestation.',
  'full': 'When the moon is whole, she mirrors the soul in its totality. In forgotten temples, this was called the Mirror Rite—where seers faced themselves and became luminous.',
  'waning-gibbous': 'The moon exhales light and knowledge alike. Hermetic texts call this the harvest of reflection, when gratitude anchors the lessons of illumination into the subtle body.',
  'last-quarter': 'Here the light contracts, drawing the spirit inward. Secret traditions speak of the Serpent Gate—an initiation through release and dissolution of false forms.',
  'waning-crescent': 'The final breath before rebirth. In the silence of surrender, mystics say the moon whispers to those who remember—the promise that endings are gateways disguised as sleep.',
