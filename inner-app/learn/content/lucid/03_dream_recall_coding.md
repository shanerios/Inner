# Dream Recall & Dream Coding

**Goal:** Build reliable dream recall using micro-awakening capture and a simple code system that makes patterns obvious.

---

## Tonight’s Quick Start
- Say: *“Tonight I remember my dreams.”*
- Pick one cue (e.g., doors, clocks).
- On waking: freeze → tag emotion/setting/anomaly → jot 1–2 sentences.
---

## Why It Matters
Most people treat recall as luck. It’s a *skill*. Your brain saves what it believes is **valuable**. We exploit this by:
- **Value-Priming**: telling the brain dreams matter.
- **Micro-Awakening Capture**: catching details when recall is sharpest.
- **Dream Coding**: tagging entries so patterns become clear and reusable.

## What You Need
- Notebook + pen *or* voice recorder
- Very dim light or red filter
- Optional: scent anchor (same each night)
- Optional: gentle alarm at ~6 hours

---

## Evening Protocol
1. **Value-Priming (1 min):** *“Tonight I remember my dreams. I will wake with details waiting for me.”*
2. **One-Line Cue (1 min):** e.g., *“I’ll notice doors and thresholds.”*
3. **Scent Anchor (10 sec):** Inhale briefly.
4. **Journal Prep (1 min):** Fresh page, date, cue written down.
5. **Optional:** Gentle wake 6 hours after sleep onset.

---

## Micro-Awakening Capture (in-night)
1. **Freeze (5–10 sec):** Stay still, eyes closed.
2. **Three Hooks (10 sec):**
   - Emotion
   - Setting
   - Anomaly
3. **Skeleton (10–15 sec):** Whisper/think a 1–3 sentence summary.

*Mantra:* **“Sketch the map, not the city.”**

---

## Morning Ladder
1. **Eyes closed recap (30–60 sec).**
2. **Bullets → Timeline (1–2 min).**
3. **Code It (1–2 min):** Add Dream Code tags, circle dreamsigns.

---

## Dream Code (tags)
- ⚑ DS = Dreamsign  
- 🕰 HP = Hypnopompic  
- 🎭 CH = Character  
- 🚪 TH = Threshold  
- 🌊 EL = Elemental motif  
- ✳ RC = Reality Check  
- 🔁 REP = Repeat motif  

### Sample Entry
*Example dream journal line:*
> “In a neon city, I climbed a glass elevator. Relief after escaping the underground tunnel.”

*Applied tags:* `⚑ DS, 🚪 TH, ✳ RC`

---

## Daily Micro-Practices
- **Two-Sentence Rule (AM):** Minimum 2 sentences daily.
- **One Dreamstep (PM):** Pause at a doorway and ask, *“Is this a dream?”*
- **Cue Refresh (30 sec):** Write a new one-line cue each night.

---

## 7-Day Jumpstart
- **Days 1–2:** Build habit, focus on freeze + hooks.
- **Days 3–4:** Add Dream Code + Dreamstep.
- **Days 5–6:** Optional gentle 6-hour wake.
- **Day 7:** Review week, circle repeating dreamsigns, set next cue.

---

## Advanced Moves
- **Scent Reversal:** Use scent both before sleep and during recall.  
- **Audio Tag:** Same soft chime before bed and at morning recap.  
- **Hypnopompic Drill:** 60 sec re-run in present tense before journaling.  
- **Memory Palace:** Place dreamsigns in a mental house; walk it nightly.

---

## Troubleshooting
- *Remember nothing?* Write mood/body image anyway.  
- *Fall back asleep?* Use voice memo for skeleton.  
- *Alarms wreck sleep?* Skip mid-night wake.  
- *Only fragments?* Title and tag them — they often expand later.  

---

## Metrics
- **RDS** – Recall Day Streak  
- **ADR** – Average Dreams per morning  
- **DS/wk** – Dreamsigns per week  
- **Cue Hit Rate** – How often cues appear  

---

## Inner App Pairing
- **Pre-sleep:** Play *Harmonic Resonance* at low volume.  
- **Morning:** Use “Recall” button for quick-entry tags.  
- **Glossary links:** *Dreamsign, Hypnopompic, Reality Check, Thresholds*.  

---

## This Week’s Challenge
- Log 5/7 mornings.  
- Tag at least 3 dreamsigns.  
- Choose your next cue from repeating patterns.

---
## Reflection Prompt
- Which emotion showed up most this week?
- Did it mirror anything in waking life?
- How might that emotion be a *gateway* to lucidity?
