# Reality Checks & Daily Habits

**Goal:** Train the mind to question reality in waking life so that awareness carries into dreams, triggering lucidity.

---

## Why It Matters
Dream recall gave you the map. Reality checks give you the *key*. They work because habits of awareness bleed into dreams. When you genuinely question reality during the day, you eventually do the same in a dream—and the dream answers.

---

## Tonight’s Quick Start
- Ask yourself *“Am I dreaming?”* every time you walk through a doorway.  
- Pair the question with one physical check (hands, clocks, or breath).  
- Log at least 8 checks tomorrow.

## Core Practices

### The 3 Classic Reality Checks
- **Finger Count:** Look at your hands. Count twice. Fingers often distort in dreams.  
- **Text/Clock Test:** Look away, then back—text and numbers rarely stay stable.  
- **Nose Pinch:** Pinch your nose and try to breathe—possible in dreams.

### Angles Few People Mention
- **Peripheral Blur Check:** Glance to the side. In dreams, peripheral detail is fuzzy or unstable.  
- **Light Switch Test:** Toggle a switch. In dreams, light levels rarely change correctly.  
- **Body Reflection:** Look at yourself in a mirror or phone camera. In dreams, reflections warp or don’t appear.  
- **Physics Probe:** Drop a small object (key, pen). Does it fall with proper weight? Dreams often alter gravity subtly.

## Habit Stacking
Tie checks to:
- Every doorway (threshold consciousness)  
- Every time you check your phone  
- Strong emotions (anger, joy, fear)  
- Seeing repeating numbers (11:11, 2:22)

## Dreamsign Targeting
Use Lesson #3’s Dream Codes. If you tagged thresholds or water, check whenever you see them during the day.

## Totems & Anchors
Carry a small object (coin, bead, stone).  
- Touch it = reality check.  
- In dreams, this “artifact” can appear and act as a trigger.  
- Unique tip: give the object a *word* or *sigil* meaning (e.g., carve a rune). In dreams, symbols tend to “wake” awareness faster than plain objects.

---

## Daily Routine
- **Morning:** Review dream journal, circle dreamsigns.  
- **Daytime:** Perform 8–10 checks anchored to triggers.  
- **Evening:** As you drift to sleep, visualize doing one check in a dream.

---

## Advanced Practices
- **Chain Checks:** Never stop at one. If it passes, do a second.  
- **Quality over Quantity:** One mindful, serious check > ten autopilot ones.  
- **Social Reality Checks:** Ask a friend to do a check with you. Shared awareness multiplies effect.  
- **Edge-State Checks:** Train yourself to reality check when you’re groggy—half-asleep moments mirror dream states.  
- **Time Distortion Check:** Stare at a clock for 20+ seconds. In dreams, time wobbles, speeds, or stalls.

---

## Troubleshooting
- *Forgetting?* Use sticky notes, phone alarms, or wear a wristband as a reminder.  
- *Feels fake?* Stop and imagine: *“If this were a dream, what would feel off?”*  
- *No dream carryover?* Stick with it—usually 1–3 weeks before results show.

---

## Metrics
- **Checks/day** (aim 8–10)  
- **Check quality** (1–5 scale)  
- **Dream carryover** (# of checks appearing in dreams)

---

## This Week’s Challenge
- Perform at least 8 reality checks daily.  
- Tie them to **your dreamsigns**.  
- Record at least one “in-dream” check or near miss.

## Reflection Prompt
- Did any reality checks surprise you with clarity today?  
- Which dreamsigns crossed over into waking checks?  
- How does questioning reality affect how you see waking life?
