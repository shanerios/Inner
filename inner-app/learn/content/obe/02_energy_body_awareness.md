# Energy Body Awareness

**Goal:** Build sensitivity to the “second body” (the subtle/energy body) so separation from the physical becomes possible.

---

## Why It Matters
Most OBE methods fail because people try to “exit” without first feeling the body they’re trying to move. This lesson teaches you to sense, expand, and strengthen your energy double.

---

## Tonight’s Quick Start
- Lie down and breathe slowly.  
- Imagine energy flowing up and down your body in waves.  
- Focus on one limb until it feels heavy, buzzing, or tingling.

---

## Core Practices

### 1. Energy Sweep
- Visualize a wave moving from head to toe and back, like brushing with light.  
- Sync with breath: inhale (down), exhale (up).  
- Aim for a humming, vibrating sensation.

### 2. Limb Heaviness Drill
- Focus only on your hand or foot.  
- Imagine it swelling, buzzing, or filling with light.  
- When sensation grows, try to “move” the energy version of the limb without moving physically.

### 3. Whole-Body Flood
- After practicing limbs, imagine the entire body glowing or vibrating.  
- The aim is a cocoon-like awareness beyond physical boundaries.

## Advanced Angles (Less Common)
- **Phantom Wiggle:** Try micro-movements (wiggling dream fingers or toes) without physical muscles. Many report this unlocks OBE exits.  
- **Magnet Field Method:** Imagine your body is magnetic, pulling energy in on inhale, pushing out on exhale.  
- **Energy Expansion:** Picture your body doubling in size, then shrinking back—primes the sense of “slipping out.”  
- **Tactile Substitution:** Imagine different textures (silk, stone, water) brushing your skin—trains nonphysical touch.

---

## Daily Practices
- Brief 2–3 minute “phantom limb focus” while awake.  
- Practice noticing subtle tingles when relaxed (after meditation, before sleep).  
- Ground by touching real textures afterwards so you don’t dissociate.

---

## Troubleshooting
- *No sensations?* Start small—focus on fingertips or toes.  
- *Too restless?* Slow breathing; use a background hum or white noise to anchor.  
- *Scared by vibrations?* Reframe them as proof the energy body is active—not dangerous.

---

## Metrics
- **Times phantom sensations felt per week**  
- **Body areas activated**  
- **Strength of sensations (1–5 scale)**

---

## This Week’s Challenge
- Activate at least one limb every night.  
- Record what sensations show up and whether you can “move” the energy limb.

---

## Reflection Prompt
- Which part of your body is easiest to activate?  
- What sensations surprised you the most?  
- Did you feel more “in” your energy body than your physical body?
