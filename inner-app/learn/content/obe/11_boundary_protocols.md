# Boundary Protocols & Entity Etiquette

**Goal:** Learn how to set boundaries, establish sovereignty, and interact respectfully with entities or presences encountered during OBEs.

---

## Lore & Context
Explorers across traditions have spoken of encounters in nonphysical realms:
- Shamans met spirit guides, ancestors, and trickster forces.  
- Yogic adepts described beings of light and shadow testing their stability.  
- Modern OBE accounts include benevolent guides, neutral wanderers, and occasionally unsettling presences.

Boundaries ensure safety and clarity. Just as in waking life, discernment and etiquette determine the quality of interaction.

## Tonight’s Quick Start
- Upon encountering a presence, pause.  
- Affirm inwardly: *“I am sovereign in light. Only what serves my highest good may remain.”*  
- Observe how the presence responds.  
- Engage with openness if calm, or withdraw if unsettled.

---

## Core Practices

### 1. Sovereignty Affirmations
- Speak clearly: *“This is my space.”*  
- Use your Sanctum Sphere if needed—expand it outward.  
- Repeat until the environment steadies.

### 2. Intent Test
- Ask directly: *“Do you come in light?”* or *“What is your purpose here?”*  
- Trust the first response—verbal, visual, or energetic.  
- If unclear, step back and reaffirm your boundary.

### 3. Respectful Engagement
- Address presences as equals, not enemies.  
- Offer gratitude for guidance, but maintain discernment.  
- End interactions with clarity: *“Thank you. I return now.”*

## Advanced Angles
- **Handshake Protocol:** Extend your hand and note the sensation—warmth often signals alignment, cold or static may warn of discord.  
- **Code Phrases:** Develop personal phrases like *“Only truth remains”* or *“Reveal your nature now.”*  
- **Exit Authority:** If threatened, command firmly: *“I end this encounter.”* Then shift location or return.  
- **Council Etiquette:** In multi-entity spaces (councils, circles), wait to be addressed before speaking. Observe protocols as in sacred gatherings.

## Daily Practices
- Practice sovereignty in waking life: say no when needed, maintain boundaries with respect.  
- Journal personal affirmations you can use in OBEs.  
- Meditate briefly on your Sanctum Sphere each day to strengthen it as a shield.

---

## Troubleshooting
- *Overwhelmed by presence?* Retreat into your Sanctum Sphere.  
- *Entity ignores boundary?* State intent louder, use visual reinforcement (light expanding).  
- *Fear dominates?* End the session—there is no shame in retreat. Safety comes first.

## Metrics
- **Number of encounters with presences**  
- **Boundary affirmations used**  
- **Clarity of interactions (1–5 scale)**

## This Week’s Challenge
- In your next OBE, practice one sovereignty affirmation when meeting a presence.  
- Log how the presence responded.

## Reflection Prompt
- How did entities respond to your boundaries?  
- Did you feel more confident and sovereign?
