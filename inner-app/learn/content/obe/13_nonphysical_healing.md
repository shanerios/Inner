# Advanced: Healing in the Nonphysical

**Goal:** Use the Out-of-Body state to restore, balance, and harmonize energy—for yourself, for others, and within shared nonphysical healing spaces.

---

## Lore & Context
Healing through OBEs has been whispered about in many traditions:
- Shamans described traveling to spirit realms to retrieve lost soul fragments or restore health.  
- Yogic adepts visualized subtle energy flows to dissolve blockages.  
- Modern explorers report finding healing temples or meeting luminous beings who transmit restorative light.

Unlike lucid dreams, OBEs often feel more direct, more energetic—making them uniquely suited to transformational healing practices.

## Tonight’s Quick Start
- After exit, pause and steady your awareness.  
- Place your hands on your nonphysical body where healing is needed.  
- Say: *“Healing now.”*  
- Visualize radiant light flowing through you.  
- Stay until you feel a shift in energy, warmth, or calm.

---

## Core Practices

### 1. Self-Healing
- Scan your nonphysical body for tension, darkness, or distortion.  
- Place your hands there or imagine golden light filling the space.  
- Repeat affirmations: *“I restore. I balance. I heal.”*

### 2. Receiving Healing
- Ask: *“Show me the healer.”*  
- Allow guides, radiant beings, or ancestral figures to appear.  
- Accept their touch, sound, or light without resistance.  
- Express gratitude before leaving.

### 3. Sending Healing
- Focus on a loved one or collective cause.  
- Visualize their image or name glowing before you.  
- Send light or energy through your hands, heart, or Sanctum Sphere.  
- Affirm: *“May only what serves their highest good be shared.”*

## Advanced Angles
- **Healing Temples:** Many report entering halls of light where groups of healers work. Ask to be taken there.  
- **Elemental Methods:** Bathe yourself in dream-fire, water, wind, or earth to restore balance.  
- **Soul Retrieval:** Call forth lost parts of yourself and reintegrate them with compassion.  
- **Collective Healing:** Join circles of healers in nonphysical space—often councils extend invitations once intent is strong.

---

## Daily Practices
- Practice short visualizations of self-healing light during waking meditation.  
- Journal health, mood, or energy shifts after OBE healing attempts.  
- Affirm nightly: *“I heal and am healed in higher states.”*

---

## Troubleshooting
- *Nothing happens?* Begin with simple light visualization—healing often strengthens with repetition.  
- *Fear or doubt arises?* Reaffirm sovereignty: *“Only what serves my good may remain.”*  
- *Overextended?* Always end with grounding—breathe, touch your body, and drink water after sessions.
