# Mastery: Psychopomp Partnership

**Goal:** Learn to connect with and work alongside psychopomp figures—guides of transition who assist souls in crossing thresholds of death, rebirth, and transformation.

---

## Lore & Context
The term *psychopomp* means “guide of souls.” Across cultures, beings have held this role:
- In Greek tradition, Hermes escorted souls to the underworld.  
- In Norse lore, the Valkyries carried fallen warriors to Valhalla.  
- Shamans often act as psychopomps during ceremonies, guiding lost or restless spirits.  
- Modern OBE explorers sometimes encounter luminous guides who help with transitions—personal, ancestral, or collective.

Working with psychopomps is not about fascination with death—it is about learning to hold presence at thresholds, to assist in release, and to deepen your own sovereignty.

---

## Tonight’s Quick Start
- In OBE, state: *“I call upon the guide of safe passage.”*  
- Wait for a figure to appear—human, animal, or luminous.  
- Ask: *“Will you walk with me?”*  
- Observe their energy—calm, supportive presences are key.  
- Follow only if you feel secure.

## Core Practices

### 1. Meeting the Psychopomp
- Call with intention: *“Show me the one who guides with light.”*  
- Accept the form they take, whether familiar or symbolic.  
- Trust your discernment—true psychopomps do not coerce.

### 2. Walking Thresholds
- Allow the guide to lead you to symbolic thresholds: rivers, gates, or bridges.  
- Observe without fear—these are spaces of transition.  
- Ask for teachings relevant to your own path.

### 3. Acts of Assistance
- Some experiences may involve helping lost figures cross.  
- Offer presence, compassion, and affirm: *“You are free to go with light.”*  
- Always ground yourself after assisting.

## Advanced Angles
- **Ancestral Work:** Ask the guide to show you ancestral lines that need release.  
- **Collective Thresholds:** At times, psychopomps work with groups—observe, but do not interfere unless invited.  
- **Shadow Integration:** Meeting dark or unsettled presences can be part of the work; bring them gently into light.  
- **Becoming the Guide:** With time, you may be invited to act as psychopomp yourself—always with humility and care.

---

## Daily Practices
- Reflect on transitions in waking life—endings, beginnings, grief, release.  
- Meditate on compassion, sending peace to those in transition.  
- Journal dreams or visions of guides, animals, or ancestral figures.

---

## Troubleshooting
- *Frightening figures appear?* Reaffirm sovereignty: *“Only guides of light may remain.”*  
- *Unclear guidance?* Ask directly: *“Are you of the light?”*  
- *Overwhelmed?* Return to your Astral Sanctuary and end the session.

## Metrics
- **Number of encounters with psychopomp figures**  
- **Threshold experiences recorded**  
- **Teachings or releases facilitated**

- Record their appearance, teachings, and any threshold spaces visited.
