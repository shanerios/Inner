# Energetic Locomotion: Moving in the Nonphysical

**Goal:** Learn reliable methods of movement after separation, using intention, energy, and focus to navigate nonphysical space.

---

## Lore & Context
One of the most common challenges after a successful exit is the sensation of being *stuck* near the body. Mystics and explorers alike describe learning to move as a second initiation:
- Ancient shamanic journeys spoke of being “carried by spirit winds” to far places.  
- Yogic texts reference the *siddhi* of flying through subtle realms.  
- Modern OBE accounts often describe gliding, magnetic pulls, or thought-based travel.

Movement in the nonphysical is not muscular—it is energetic and intentional. Mastering this skill unlocks exploration beyond the bedroom and into vast domains of experience.

## Tonight’s Quick Start
- Once separated, pause and breathe.  
- Focus on a simple intention: *“To the door”* or *“Upward.”*  
- Feel yourself glide in that direction without effort.  
- If pulled back, reaffirm separation and repeat the motion.

---

## Core Practices

### 1. Intention Glide
- Point your awareness toward a location.  
- Feel yourself already there.  
- Let the environment shift around you as if consciousness jumped forward.

### 2. Magnetic Pull
- Choose a distant object (door, window, tree).  
- Imagine it pulling you like a magnet.  
- Allow yourself to be drawn swiftly.

### 3. Momentum Roll
- If stuck, roll forward, backward, or sideways with your subtle body.  
- Keep the motion continuous until you find flow.

### 4. Flight Expansion
- Spread your arms or feel wings unfold.  
- Launch upward, letting buoyancy lift you like air.  
- Use breath as propulsion.

## Advanced Angles
- **Teleportation:** State clearly: *“Take me to [place].”* Notice the instant shift in scenery.  
- **Energy Trails:** Imagine leaving a glowing path behind you; it strengthens movement.  
- **Tether Stretching:** Visualize your connection to the body as elastic—stretch it outward until the body fades from awareness.  
- **Anchor Jumping:** Move from anchor to anchor (bed → door → sky → star), building distance step by step.

---

## Daily Practices
- Practice intention movement during meditation: visualize gliding across a room.  
- In waking life, set micro-intentions (“to the door”) and notice how focus directs action.  
- Journal post-dream/OBE: log which locomotion method you attempted.

---

## Troubleshooting
- *Feel glued to body?* Reaffirm: *“I am out.”* Then roll or float persistently.  
- *Pulled back suddenly?* Stabilize by moving farther away quickly (through a window or door).  
- *Drift without control?* Focus sharply on a single destination to regain steering.

---

## Metrics
- **Number of successful movements beyond the body**  
- **Method used (glide, pull, roll, flight)**  
- **Clarity of navigation (1–5 scale)**  

---

## This Week’s Challenge
- In your next OBE, attempt at least two locomotion methods.  
- Record which worked best and how far you traveled.

---

## Reflection Prompt
- Which locomotion technique felt most natural?  
- Did you encounter resistance or sudden pulls back?  
- How did moving freely change your sense of OBE exploration?
