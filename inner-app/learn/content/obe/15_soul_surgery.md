# Advanced: Soul Surgery & Deep Repair

**Goal:** Engage in the practice of deep energetic repair—using the OBE state to witness, cleanse, and reconstruct aspects of the self that feel wounded, fragmented, or distorted.

---

## Lore & Context
Throughout esoteric traditions, healers have spoken of performing “operations” on the subtle body:
- Shamans describe extracting intrusive energies or entities.  
- Tibetan practices detail visualizing luminous surgery to purify karmic residue.  
- Modern OBE explorers sometimes report luminous beings working on them with instruments of light.  

The nonphysical state allows for symbolic-yet-powerful interventions—surgery of the soul that can bring real shifts in energy, emotion, and health.

## Tonight’s Quick Start
- After stabilizing in OBE, state: *“Reveal what needs repair.”*  
- Allow symbols of wounds, breaks, or intrusions to appear.  
- Place hands over the area, or invite guides to assist.  
- Visualize golden instruments or light repairing the site.  
- Seal with breath: inhale light, exhale release.

## Core Practices

### 1. Scanning the Energy Body
- Ask inwardly: *“Where am I fractured or carrying distortion?”*  
- Notice sensations: heaviness, darkness, or gaps.  
- Trust the imagery—wounds often appear as cracks, shards, or shadowed spaces.

### 2. Performing the Repair
- Call forth tools of light—scalpels, threads, crystal wands.  
- Remove what feels intrusive or stagnant.  
- Fill the gap with luminous energy until whole.

### 3. Inviting Assistance
- Ask: *“Healers of light, assist me now.”*  
- Allow beings to approach—watch their work without resistance.  
- Thank them when the repair feels complete.

## Advanced Angles
- **Extraction:** Pull out dark shards, cords, or parasites—dissolve them in fire or light.  
- **Reconstruction:** If a part is missing, call it back—invite lost fragments of self to return.  
- **Energetic Transplants:** Replace distorted energy with fresh streams from higher light.  
- **Collective Surgery:** Offer your presence in a healing circle where multiple beings perform simultaneous repair.

---

## Daily Practices
- Spend 5 minutes in meditation scanning your body for tension or distortion.  
- Journal any imagery or sensations that arise—many are precursors to OBE surgery.  
- Affirm nightly: *“I am whole. I allow deep repair.”*

---

## Troubleshooting
- *Fear of what appears?* Remember: symbols are gateways to healing, not threats.  
- *Process feels incomplete?* Repeat across multiple OBEs—healing is often layered.  
- *Exhausted afterward?* Rest, hydrate, and ground—surgery work can be intense.

---

## Metrics
- **Number of repairs attempted**  
- **Types of imbalances encountered**  
- **Perceived shifts in waking health, mood, or energy**

## This Week’s Challenge
- Attempt one soul surgery session this week.  
- Record what was revealed, how you or your guides repaired it, and how you felt after.

## Reflection Prompt
- What wound or distortion appeared most vividly?  
- How did the repair process unfold?
