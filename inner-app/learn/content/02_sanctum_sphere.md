# Sanctum Sphere

The Sanctum Sphere is your personal energetic space â€” a safe zone that you create and expand to protect and stabilize your awareness during OBE work.

### Steps to Create:
1. Sit comfortably and close your eyes.
2. Visualize a soft, radiant sphere of light forming around you.
3. With each inhale, imagine the sphere glowing brighter and expanding.
4. With each exhale, release tension, allowing your space to feel calmer and more secure.

> **Reminder:** This sphere grows stronger with each practice, becoming your sanctuary within the inner realms.
