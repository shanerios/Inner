# Meditation Practice

Meditation calms the mind and sharpens your focus, key skills for inducing OBEs and lucid dreams.

### Steps:
1. Find a quiet, comfortable space.
2. Focus on your breath â€” slow and steady.
3. Let thoughts drift without engagement.

> **Bonus:** Try binaural beats tuned for theta brainwaves to deepen the state.
