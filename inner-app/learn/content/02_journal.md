# Dream Journal

Recording your dreams consistently strengthens dream recall and helps you recognize dream patterns.

### Steps:
1. Keep your journal beside your bed.
2. Write down dreams immediately upon waking.
3. Highlight key symbols, emotions, and themes.

> **Reflection:** Over time, youâ€™ll begin to spot repeating symbols that indicate you're dreaming.
