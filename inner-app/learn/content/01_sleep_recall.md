# Sleep Recall

Sleep recall is the foundation of lucid dreaming and out-of-body practices.  
Each morning, before moving, let your mind replay the fragments of your dreams.  

### Steps:
1. Remain still upon waking.
2. Rewind your dreams like a movie, capturing every detail.
3. Write them down in your journal immediately.

> **Pro Tip:** Keep your journal and pen on your nightstand for quick access.
