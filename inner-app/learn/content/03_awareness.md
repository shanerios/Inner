# Daytime Awareness

Lucidity begins during the day. By training awareness, you teach your mind to recognize when it’s dreaming.

### Steps:
1. Pause multiple times a day and observe your surroundings.
2. Ask yourself: *“Am I dreaming?”*
3. Look for subtle inconsistencies or dream-like cues.

> **Tip:** Pair these checks with daily tasks, like opening a door or looking at your phone.
