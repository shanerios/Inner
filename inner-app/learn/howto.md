# Welcome to the Learning Hub

This is your space to **learn**, **integrate**, and **track progress** alongside your practice with Chambers and Soundscapes.

## What’s inside

### Lessons
Short, focused modules (2–6 minutes) you can read between sessions. Each lesson ends with **one thing to do tonight**.

**Tip:** Lessons are grouped by path (Lucid / OBE). Start with *Intro* and *Prep* in your chosen path.

### Glossary
Quick definitions for terms used across Inner (e.g., *WILD, Vibrational State, Sanctum Sphere*). Great for fast refreshers mid-practice.

### Progress
Your scroll/read position is saved automatically. You’ll see progress bars on lesson cards and can resume where you left off.

## How progress works

- **Auto-save:** As you scroll a lesson, your progress is saved.
- **Resume:** Leaving a lesson and coming back reopens near your last position.
- **Completion:** Scrolling to the end marks the lesson complete (you can always revisit).

*If your progress doesn’t feel right after a reinstall or device change, just open the lesson and scroll a little—Inner will re-sync.*

## A simple 7-day starter plan

**Day 1** — *Orientation*  
- Read: Lucid/OBE **Intro**  
- Action: Set a **single intention** for this week.

**Day 2** — *Priming*  
- Read: **Prep** (sleep setup, journal, hydration)  
- Action: Place your journal + pen beside the bed.

**Day 3** — *Checks & Recall*  
- Read: **Reality Checks / Dream Signs** (or OBE Relaxation)  
- Action: 5 reality checks during the day or a 10-minute relaxation at night.

**Day 4** — *Timing*  
- Read: **Sleep Cycles / WBTB**  
- Action: Try a 10–20 minute WBTB window, then return to bed.

**Day 5** — *Entry*  
- Read: **WILD / Exit Methods**  
- Action: Practice one entry method gently (no forcing).

**Day 6** — *Stabilize*  
- Read: **Stabilization**  
- Action: Use touch/breath or dream spinning to anchor.

**Day 7** — *Integration*  
- Read: **Grounding & Journaling**  
- Action: Write the key insights. Set next week’s intention.

## Tips for momentum

- **One idea per night:** Don’t cram; let the practice breathe.  
- **Journal first:** Even one line counts. It trains recall.  
- **Gentle > force:** Curiosity keeps the door open. Forcing closes it.  
- **Return anytime:** Progress saves; life happens.

## FAQ

**Do I need to read all lessons first?**  
No. Skim intros, then alternate: **one lesson → one practice**.

**Where do I start—Lucid or OBE?**  
Pick the path that calls you. Many seekers explore both over time.

**What if I get sleep paralysis?**  
Stay calm, breathe slowly, and use it as a gentle entry or wait it out. It passes.

**Are Inner-exclusive terms important?**  
They help build shared language. Check the Glossary anytime you see a new term (e.g., *Sanctum Sphere, Inner Resonance*).
