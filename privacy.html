  <h1>Privacy Policy for Inner</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 23, 2025</p>

  <p>At Inner, your privacy is deeply valued. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the Inner app.</p>

    <li><strong>Optional Features:</strong> If future features such as account creation, cloud backup, or synced experiences are added, you will be informed and prompted for consent before any data is used.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>All user data (such as selected intentions) is used strictly to enhance your personal experience within the app. It is not shared, sold, or used for advertising purposes.</p>

  <h2>3. Offline-First Design</h2>

  <p>We do not use cookies or display third-party advertisements in the Inner app.</p>

  <h2>5. Analytics</h2>
  <p>We may use anonymous, aggregated usage statistics (if implemented in the future) to improve the app. No personally identifiable data is ever collected without your knowledge.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access the information stored locally (e.g. your intentions)</li>
    <li>Reset or delete your local data through the app settings (if provided)</li>
    <li>Decline any future features that require external data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update this page and notify users through the app if the changes are significant.</p>
